# Connect Four

This is a web version of a classic Connect Four game. The goal is for the player to get four game pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Whoever reaches this point first wins!

Connect Four has a lot of nostalgia-value for me; I frequently played it with my four younger siblings growing up so I decided to build a web version and share it with them!
